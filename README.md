# WeatherNow

WeatherNow is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that provides weather forecasts for cities around the world. The app fetches data from a weather API, displays weather conditions, and allows users to search for different locations.

## Accomplishments

### üõ†Ô∏è **Project Setup**
- Created a SwiftUI-based iOS project using `MVVM` architecture.
- Integrated `SwiftData` for persistence.
- Configured API integration using `WeatherAPI.com`.
- Implemented environment setup for production and UI testing.

### üîç **Search Functionality**
- Implemented a search bar to find city weather.
- Added accessibility identifiers for UI testing.
- Enhanced the search result card to include:
  - Dynamic temperature and condition display.
  - Accessibility support for automated testing.
  - Proper padding, layout adjustments, and animations.

### üñ•Ô∏è **User Interface Improvements**
- Updated UI layout to match Figma design specifications.
  - Aligned weather image above the city name.
  - Added a location icon next to the city name.
  - Adjusted font sizes and colors for consistency.
  - Implemented conditional spacing when no city is selected.
- Improved design responsiveness with adaptive layouts.
- Implemented animations for error messages (fade out after 2 seconds).

### üì¶ **Data Persistence**
- Implemented local persistence using `UserDefaults` to store the last searched city.
- Implemented functions to:
  - Save the selected city.
  - Load the saved city upon app launch.
  - Clear saved city data when necessary.

### üåê **Networking and API Handling**
- Integrated `URLSession` for network calls with `async/await`.
- Added error handling for network failures and invalid city inputs.
- Implemented mock API service for UI testing.
- Successfully handled the `is_day` field to dynamically display day/night icons.

### üß™ **Unit Testing**
Achieved **>80% code coverage** with comprehensive unit tests for:
1. **Weather Model Decoding**
   - Successfully decoded valid JSON responses.
   - Handled missing fields and unexpected JSON structures.
   - Validated extreme weather values.
   - Ensured correct temperature unit conversions (Celsius to Fahrenheit).

2. **WeatherViewModel Functionality**
   - Tested fetching weather success and failure cases.
   - Verified persistence mechanisms (`save`, `load`, `clear` operations).
   - Ensured accurate error message handling.

3. **UserDefaults Persistence**
   - Verified persistence and clearing of saved city data.
   - Ensured reliability through sequential test execution.

### üß© **UI Testing**
- Successfully set up `XCUITest` framework with UI tests to verify:
  - Search field input and result card display.
  - City selection persistence across app launches.
  - Error message visibility on invalid search.
  - Navigation to the weather detail screen.
- Used `accessibilityIdentifiers` to locate and assert UI elements reliably.
- Overcame challenges with mock API service setup using `AppDelegate`.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Mocking and Test Setup**
- Integrated a mock API service to bypass real API calls during testing.
- Implemented environment flag-based service switching for UI tests.
- Fixed issues with mock API detection using `ProcessInfo.environment`.
- Used dependency injection for testing flexibility.

### üöÄ **Build and CI Improvements**
- Resolved `Testing` module alias conflicts in the UI Test target.
- Cleaned up test dependencies and ensured smooth execution.
- Ensured a clean CI pipeline with test coverage reports.

## Next Steps
- Further refine the UI tests to cover more complex user interactions.
- Consider implementing snapshot tests for visual validation.
- Improve network request caching for better performance.
- Add localization support for multiple languages.
